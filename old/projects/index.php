				<h2>VocSyl: Real-Time Multisyllabic Speech Visualization</h2>
				<h3>Josh Hailpern</h3>
				<p>VocSyl is a real-time audio visualization system for use within a clinical speech-therapy setting. To teach multisyllabic speech production, we visualize changes in syllables, timing (speed), tone (pitch) and emphasis (volume).</p>

				<h2>The Clotho Project: Predicting Application Utility</h2>
				<h3>Josh Hailpern</h3>
				<p>When using the computer, each user has some notion that "these applications are important" at a given point in time. Existing techniques fail to identify at least 57% of these applications. Our work directly associates measurable computer interaction (CPU consumption, window area, etc.) with the userâ€™s perceived application utility/importance without identifying task.</p>
