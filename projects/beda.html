		<h1>Behavioral & External Data Analysis Tool Motivation</h1>
			<p>BEDA supports use of multimodal data for longitudinal studies where common challenges are visualization, synchronization, and analysis of many sessions of data. There are many studies in Psychology and Special Education using mutlimodal and longitudinal data. Our tool was inspired by one of the studies we were conducting with special education researchers. An interdisciplinary team of researchers from Computer Science and Special Education conduct a study that explores efficacy of Sensory Integration (SI) therapy. SI therapy is often used to help individuals who have difficulties in integrating sensory inputs. However, we lack rigorous research showing relationships between SI therapy and changes in either behavior or arousal level. An occupational therapist who we collaborate with specifically recommended a pressure vest for one of the SI therapies. In this way, we explore whether wearing a pressure vest would produce changes in behavior and arousal levels.</p>

		<h1>Getting Started</h1>
			<p><h2>Configuration: Connecting Matlab</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Open BEDA</li>
					<li>Go to the menu bar and click the Preference menu under the BEDA menu.</li>
					<li>The BEDA preference window will be opened. In the BEDA preference window, please find your Matlab application by clicking the Find Matlab button.</li>
					<li>Push OK button. Now, BEDA is successfully connected to your Matlab.</li>
