		<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Brant is in his final year as student in the Graduate School of Library and Information Science. He has been working at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Social Visualization, Information Retrieval, and Health Informatics. His goal is to develop software tools to support chronic illness patients. The tools will facilitate support group like interactions, information gathering, evaluation of treatment options and status monitoring. Patient interactions will refine and drive machine learning techniques to allow primary care physicians to evaluate existing treatments. The information mined from these interactions will help primary care physicians to evaluate existing treatments and create groups of similar patient cohorts to facilitate population surveillance.</p>
