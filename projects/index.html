				<h2>Plexlines</h2>
				<h3>John Lee & Sanny Lin</h3>
				<p>Plexlines are graphical timelines that visualize a person's social and communicative behavior (gaze, gesture, and speech). Each Plexline is serves as a fingerprint that can be read at a glance by researchers, clinicians, and parents.</p>

				<h2>CrowdBand: Crowdsourced Sound Composition</h2>
				<h3>Mary Pietrowicz</h3></a>
				<p>Crowdband is an automated, crowdsourced sound composition system. Requestors use the CrowdBand interface to describe the desired result, and CrowdBand automatically partitions the job into one of three kinds of mechanical turk tasks: 1) fundamental sound provision, 2) sound assembly, and 3) sound evaluation. The crowd workers' responses demonstrated that workers who are non-musicians can design sound and create novel sound compositions through our system. We also conclucded that our system facilitates the use of common compositional techniques for musically untrained workers.</p>

				<h2>SonicShapes: Visualizing Vocal Expression</h2>
				<h3>Mary Pietrowicz</h3></a>
				<p>SonicShapes is a real-time tool for the analysis and visualization of vocal expression. Many researchers have investigated speech and speaker recognition; and others focused on lie detection. Yet, the analysis and visualization of vocal expression remain relatively unexplored. Given the impact that semantic literacy had on society, what could the impact of nonsemantic literacy be? We begin to explore this question, and the potential impact that real time analysis and visualization of speech could have on other domains, such as speech therapy, medicine, and the creative arts. </p>

				<a href="clotho.html"><img src="coverphotos/clotho.jpg">
				<h2>The Clotho Project: Predicting Application Utility</h2>
				<h3>Josh Hailpern</h3></a>
				<p>When using the computer, each user has some notion that "these applications are important" at a given point in time. Existing techniques fail to identify at least 57% of these applications. Our work directly associates measurable computer interaction (CPU consumption, window area, etc.) with the user's perceived application utility/importance without identifying task.</p>
